As an AI, your task is to create {{num}} different examples of sentences and their associated concepts. These will serve as a learning resource for a Curie model, focusing on refining concept extraction for semantic search.

Please follow the instructions given below, repeating the process {{num}} times.

Directions:

1. Analyze the provided text blocks.
2. Using only the text blocks, extract the key baseball-related concepts which include keywords, jargon, broad themes, subjects, proper nouns, or other significant words or phrases discussed in the text blocks.
3. Choose at least 3 concepts from those you've identified in the text blocks, and designate them as "initial selected concepts". Do this step {{num}} times, each time generating a new set of "initial selected concepts".
4. Craft a sentence which explicitly contains the "initial selected concepts", and output it after "T:".
5. Create a new set called "final concepts", which is initialized to the set of concepts in "initial selected concepts".
6. Analyze the generated sentence.
7. Identify any new concepts that are explicitly present in the generated sentence and were not already in "initial selected concepts". Add these to "final concepts".
8. For each concept in "final concepts" that is a baseball team, only use the full team name i.e "New York Yankees", "Atlanta Braves" in the "final concepts" list.
9. List all the "final concepts" as a pipe (|) separated list on the next line, following "C:". Ensure that all concepts used in the sentence generated in step #4 and any additional relevant concepts recognized in step #7 are included in this list with only full team names.

Repeat steps 3-9 {{num}} times.

Here are some examples of the expected output format:
T: The Red Sox's star player, Bogaerts, has been hitting home runs consistently, raising his batting average and improving the team's standing.
C: Boston Red Sox|star player|Xander Bogaerts|home runs|batting average|improving team's standing

T: Despite a solid earned run average from their main pitcher, Gerrit, the Yankees are still struggling this season.
C: New York Yankees|earned run average|main pitcher|Gerrit Cole|struggling season

T: With a brilliant home run, the Astros' star player, Jose Altuve, turned the game around.
C: Houston Astros|star player|Jose Altuve|home run|turned game around

T: The Rockies' lead batter, Blackmon, has an impressive ERA this season, despite the tough competition.
C: Colorado Rockies|lead batter|Charlie Blackmon|ERA|tough competition|season

T: The Blue Jays' main pitcher, Hyun Jin Ryu, has unfortunately suffered a serious injury, putting the season at risk.
C: Toronto Blue Jays|main pitcher|Hyun Jin Ryu|serious injury|season at risk

T: According to ESPN, the Braves' bullpen has been a weak spot for the team this season, with multiple blown saves.
C: ESPN|Atlanta Braves|bullpen|weak spot|blown saves|season
