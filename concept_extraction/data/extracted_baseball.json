The batter has 20 seconds to get situated in the box and receive a pitch. I'm against putting a giant clock (or any size clock for that matter) up to count down 20 seconds between pitches and the minute for warmups. But I think umpires should tell hitters to go to hell if they step out to get the sign or whatever, and instruct the pitcher to pitch."}

{"text": "There are several reasons for this difference. The main reason is that good hitters in their prime (such as Frank Thomas and Danny Tartabull) are rarely regular DH's, even if they can't field; it's more commonly a place to put aging veterans. Another use of the DH slot is to help a player come back from injury slowly, getting his bat in the lineup without forcing him to play in the field. I would expect such players to hit worse as DH's than they did during the rest of the season. A third factor is that most player who split"}
